CS410/510: Data Management in the Cloud
Final Project

This is a final project for the Portland State University course CS410/510: Data Management in the Cloud. The class explores the differences between traditional RDBMS systems, and emerging NoSQL implementations.

Datum for this project includes highway, station, detector, and loopdata statistics provided by ODOT. The focus of the project is to implement an application that provides specific queries on freeway data stored in a NoSQL cloud-based storage system.

Google App Engine was chosen as the platform of focus for this project. Specifically, we will be using the Google App Engine Python API, along with the Google App Engine API for MapReduce to aggregate data that will be stored for future queries.
